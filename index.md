### about Python

1. Python is a widely used interpreted, high-level programming, general-purpose programming language created by Gido Van Rossum, the first edition was released in 1991.
2. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and concise syntax (especially using space indentation to divide code blocks instead of using braces or keywords).
3. Python allows developers to express ideas with less code than C++ or Java. Whether it is a small or large program, the language tries to make the structure of the program clear and clear.
4. Python has a dynamic type system and garbage collection that automatically manages memory usage and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional, and procedural programming. It has a large and extensive standard library of its own.
